		Microtrends also play a critical role in driving overconsumption, as they promote a culture of constant novelty and disposal. The speed at which these trends rise and fall encourages consumers to continuously buy new products—whether it’s clothing, technology, or decor—in order to keep up with what’s currently "in." This leads to frequent impulse purchases of items that are quickly discarded or deemed obsolete once the next trend emerges. The short lifespan of microtrends fuels a throwaway mindset, where products are treated as disposable rather than lasting. Consequently, this creates excessive waste and contributes to unsustainable consumption patterns, with both environmental and financial costs as people endlessly chase the latest trend.
