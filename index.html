		Microtrends, rapid and short-lived trends, have become increasingly prevalent in todayâ€™s fast-paced digital culture. Fueled by social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, these trends can gain and lose popularity within a matter of weeks. Although microtrends can allow individuals to find their style, microtrends often lead to a marginalization of ideas and creativity, where individuals feel pressured to follow the latest trend to fit in, resulting in a loss of personal style and individuality. As people chase the next big thing, overconsumption becomes a byproduct, with consumers frequently buying new items to stay relevant. This cycle not only fosters wastefulness but also undermines the value of self-expression by making individual tastes secondary to fleeting trends.
