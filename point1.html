		Microtrends contribute significantly to the rise of conformer culture, where individuals feel compelled to follow the latest fads in order to fit into societal norms, particularly online. With trends constantly shifting, people often adopt the most popular styles, aesthetics, or behaviors without fully considering whether these align with their true preferences or identities. Over time, this erodes individuality, as personal expression becomes overshadowed by the desire to conform to ever-changing standards. Instead of cultivating a unique sense of style or values, many people fall into a cycle of mimicry, prioritizing external validation over personal authenticity. This relentless pursuit of trendiness fosters a homogeneity in culture, leaving less room for creative experimentation and self-exploration.
